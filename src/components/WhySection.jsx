            Every meal starts somewhere—often with a farmer who woke before dawn, 
            a producer who tends to quality over quantity, and a small business owner 
            who believes in doing things the right way.

          <p className="why-text">
            Yet finding these partners shouldn't feel like a guessing game. Too often, 
            kitchens struggle to source locally while farmers and producers wait for 
            opportunities that never find them. The traditional supply chain creates 
            distance—both physical and relational—between those who grow and those who serve.
          </p>
          
          <p className="why-text">
            We built Farm2Fork Hub to change that. By connecting local kitchens directly 
            with local producers, we're not just simplifying sourcing—we're helping build 
            resilient, transparent food ecosystems where relationships matter and quality 
            is never compromised. Every request fulfilled is a step toward stronger communities, 
            fresher food, and a more sustainable future.
